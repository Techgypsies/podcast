<h3>Episode 9: Violations</h3>
<br />
<p>Welcome to the ninth episode of the Tech Gypsies podcast, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and <a href="http://audreywatters.com">Audrey Watters</a>' weekly discussion of the latest technology news.</p>

<p>In this episode, we talk about violence and toxic masculinity, the ethics of drones, and the joys of being out of range of the Internet and cellphone signals.</p>

<p>Here are links to the articles we reference:</p>

</ul>

<p>Feedback is welcome, but if you send it to Kin, don't expect a response as he's not checking email much these days. Apologies for the sound recording the past few weeks. Maybe we should record this podcast out in the woods, where it seems to be quieter.</p>
