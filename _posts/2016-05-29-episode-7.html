<h3>Episode 7: The API Call</h3>
<br />
<p>Welcome to the seventh episode of the Tech Gypsies podcast, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and <a href="http://audreywatters.com">Audrey Watters</a>' weekly discussion of the latest technology news.</p>

<p>In this episode, we discuss what was a huge week for API-related news: the Google v Oracle case, the Twilio IPO, and the sale of API Evangelist (which is now, thanks to the API community, unnecessary). We also talk about billionaires and lawsuits, billionaires and ed-tech investment, Trump (not a billionaire), and Sea Monkeys.</p>
