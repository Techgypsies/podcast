<h3>Episode 2: His Purple Reign</h3>
<br />
<p>Welcome to the second episode of the Tech Gypsies podcast, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and <a href="http://audreywatters.com">Audrey Watters</a>' (hopefully) weekly discussion of the latest technology news.</p>

<p>In this episode, we talk about Prince, music, technology, and the importance of controlling your own intellectual property.</p>

<p><<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/260684449&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<p>Here are the stories we discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/arts/music/prince-a-hit-maker-and-master-of-his-own-music.html">How Prince Rebelled Against the Music Industry</a>" in The New York Times</li>
<li>"<a href="https://tressiemc.com/2016/04/21/there-are-thieves-in-the-temple-tonight/">There Are Thieves In The Temple Tonight</a>" by Tressie McMillan Cottom</li>
<li>"<a href="http://tinyletter.com/audreywatters/letters/hack-education-weekly-newsletter-no-158">Hack Education Weekly Newsletter, No. 158</a>" by Audrey</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this was only our second runthrough, it's still a little rough, we recognize. Feedback is welcome. (Send it to Kin, not Audrey. She hates email.) This podcast will soon appear on iTunes and the like, once we receive approval from the almighty gatekeepers on these various technology platforms.</p>
