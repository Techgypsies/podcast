<p>Welcome to second episode of our "+1" podcast on the history of technology. This is an experiment, and there's no promise we'll keep up with this.  But we do think it's important to ground discussions of contemporary technologies in a recognition there's a history to them.</p>

<p>This episode looks at the history of the chat bot.</p>
