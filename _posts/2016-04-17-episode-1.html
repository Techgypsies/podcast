<h3>Episode 1: The Future of Bots</h3>
<br />
<p>Welcome to the first episode of the Tech Gypsies podcast, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and <a href="http://audreywatters.com">Audrey Watters</a>' (hopefully) weekly discussion of the latest technology news.</p>

<p>In this episode, we discuss bots (past, present, and future), investment patterns, Facebook's plans for the future, what happens when we can't afford the loans for our Internet-connected devices, and UC Davis' attempts to delete its pepper-spray incident from the Web.</p>
